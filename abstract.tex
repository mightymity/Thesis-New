\paragraph{}Real-time Indoor and Outdoor positioning system has long been researched and developed. The Global Positioning System (GPS) can locate the object in an outdoor environment, though, it fails to identify the location when the object is inside the building. Thus, there is a need for another technology and system to accomplish the indoor positioning. However, there are still multiple challenges concerning this indoor positioning technology due to environmental factors, such as building structure, which can hinder the signal. Moreover, the noises in Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) also lead to an inaccuracy in positioning. Hence, in this research, we propose a real time indoor and outdoor positioning system using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and GPS technology, and a method to improve the accuracy of indoor positioning by predicting the $n$ (environment variable) which is a variable in Pathloss equation that directly affect the accuracy of object position estimation.
