\chapter*{Acknowledgement}
\paragraph{}This project could not be completed if we don't have very great advices from our advisor, Asst.Prof.Dr. Chaiwat Nuthong. We also would like to thank Dr. Isara Anatavrasilp and my colleagues for giving suggestions in presentation and useful discussions. Moreover, we are thankful to our lecturers at International College for providing support and knowledge. Additionally, we would like to give special thanks to our families for their support, motivations, and encouragement. However, for those who are not mentioned above still play an important supporting for us. The project cannot be done and get the better result without their cooperations.
